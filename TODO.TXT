What we might work on:
- Adding docs
- Refining some code
- Implementing more drivers

What we're working:
- Fixing some jumping mess
- Fixing some MikeOS leftovers
- Building actual images for you to download
- Designing a website if we need one
- Maybe implementing SB16 drivers (because PC speaker setup on VirtualBox is a fucking mess)
- Fixing buildwin.bat and rely on modern win32 binaries (because arduino101 is still using Windows, what a loser)
- Rewriting docs in Markdown
